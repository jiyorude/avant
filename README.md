### Background
*Avant* is an algorithm that outputs random-generated data for the purpose of experimental and randomized video-(post)production; primarily targeting machinima-based projects. The algorithm outputs a tangible list which contains various elements that correspond to video production, video post-production, or both; such as, but not limited to framerate, runtime, camera positioning and animations, depthmap information, framerate, shot length, shot contents and an entire predetermined post-production flow.

Technically speaking, avant is able to produce data for a unlimited number of experimental machinima projects for practically every game that allows first-person camera manipulation to at least some extent and is, unlike the [DOMINION](https://www.npmjs.com/package/q3dominion?activeTab=readme) algorithm, not dependent on Quake III alone as avant contains multiple different approaches for camera data generation. 

The algorithm was named after the highly popular art movement *'avant-garde'*, as it outputs raw, randomized and unchecked data made for experimental productions. It is not until the actual production or post-production process that the user is able to see how the actual data is 'visualized'. The focus lies on the films design and graphical representation, not on its contents or story; thus staying in true *avant-garde* fashion.

### Supported Software

#### Games
* Every game that has a built-in camera manipulator and/or allows for input of camera position data. *(Dolphin Emulator, Grand Theft Auto, Quake III etc)*
* Every game that has, to some extent, support for first-person camera manipulation. *(Rollercoaster Tycoon 3, The Sims 2/3/4, Animal Crossing etc)*
* Avant aims to offer options for filmmaking in games that do not offer any kind of camera manipulation. Please be advised that your options are, safe to say, very limited.

#### DepthMap Generation
* Quake III Movie Maker's Edition
* ReShade
* DepthScanner
* Source Depth Buffer

#### Video-Editing Software
* Every NLE is supported as long as they allow to change resolution, framerate and are able to precisely measure timecodes. 
* **Recommended:** Sony Vegas Pro, Adobe Premiere Pro, Blackmagic DaVinci Resolve, AVID Media Composer

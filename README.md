### Background
*Avant* is an algorithm that outputs random-generated data for the purpose of experimental, depth-based and randomized Quake III Arena machinima production. 

The algorithm was named after the highly popular art movement *'avant-garde'*, as it outputs raw, randomized and unchecked data made for experimental productions. It is not until the actual production or post-production process that the user is able to see how the actual data is 'visualized'. The focus lies on film design and graphical representation, not on contents or story; thus staying in true *avant-garde* fashion.

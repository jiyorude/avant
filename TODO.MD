| 0.3.3 | Mapgen Testing I | Extensive testing of all mapgen functions | 0% |
| 0.3.3 | Mapgen Modes | If empty, generate data, if not empty, ask if you want to generate new data and append to new file (if user added new maps) and ask for name, or empty the current dict and start over. | 0% |
| 0.3.4 | Matplotlib | Generate PDF with information of all spawn points | 0% |
| 0.4.0 | Mapgen Complete | Mapgen modes and functions are fully working and have been tested. Mapgen has been added to Documentation website | 0%|

| 0.5.0 | Demogen complete | Demogen modes and functions are fully working and have been tested. Demogen has been added to Documentation website. | 0% |
| 0.5.1 | MMEProjGen Basic functionality | Implementing basic functionality where mme project files can be generated and rendered by mme with randomized camera movement and length | 0% |
| 0.5.2 | MMEProjGen Advanced | Allow for multiple lists to be parsed and projectfiles to be placed in different folders. Set parameters such as how many maps used, how many shots per map. Allow for shot only, depthmap only, or both. Would you like to render as DPX, PNG, TIFF, TARGA or JPG? | 0% |
| 0.5.3 | MMEProjGen DualFrame | What is your main framerate, and would you like mme to render the same shot on 200fps slow motion as well? Or do you only want slow motion or only your chosen framerate? | 0% |
| 0.5.4 | MMEProjGen Testing | Testing functions of mmeprojgen | 0%|
| 0.5.5 | Render.bat | Creating customized render.bat, add function to place all required files for capturing neatly in a new folder with instructions for the user how to place it in their q3 environment | 0% |

htu_one = "Avant is a Python algorithm designed to streamline and almost fully automate the creation of experimental Quake III machinima. It extracts map coordinates from the PK3 files you wish to use, generates demos for each spawn point found in the maps, creates randomized Q3MME camera data, and injects all this data into custom Quake III demo files and Q3MME project files. Once generated, Avant can create custom .BAT files and automatically start the offscreen capture process in Q3MME for you."
htu_two = "Additionally, Avant can output EDL or XML files for your chosen NLE, providing you with a fully randomized experimental edit that you can either export or further refine as desired. Technically speaking, Avant allows you to generate virtually unlimited variations of experimental Quake III machinima compositions, automating much of their production in the process."
htu_three = "To generate a fully automated and randomized composition of Quake III Arena machinima, follow the steps outlined below:"
htu_four = "STEP 1: MAP DATA GENERATION"
htu_five = "Avant can extract BSP files from a PK3 archive, analyze them to determine the map size and the location of all spawn points, and calculate the available space between each spawn point and 'the void' for potential randomized camera movement. Finally, the map and spawn point data, along with a 3D graph of the map, will be exported to a PDF for your convenience."
htu_six = "STEP 2: DEMO FILE GENERATION"
htu_seven = "Once map data is generated, Avant creates 'static' demo files (without player movement) for each spawn point found in each analyzed map. This ensures the algorithm can fully randomize not only which map will be used during the capturing process but also its spawnpoint of choice during production and capturing."
htu_eight = "STEP 3: MME PROJECT GENERATION"
htu_nine = "The third step involves creating automated project files for Quake III Movie Maker's Edition, which includes randomized data regarding camera movement, field of view, depth of field, and animation. It also generates the capture list and a customized .bat file. Once all files are generated, Avant will prompt you for technical details (such as framerate and image extensions) and automatically begin the offscreen capture process inside Q3MME. After completion, you can either edit the image sequences yourself or generate a randomized XML/EDL file."
htu_ten = "STEP 4: XML/EDL GENERATION"
htu_eleven = "While you can choose to edit the footage yourself, Avant can generate a fully experimental and randomized composition for you in an XML/EDL file, which can be imported into your NLE of choice. During setup, the algorithm will take your selected framerate and film duration into account. It can even reserve space for intro and outro titles, which you can add yourself during post-production."
